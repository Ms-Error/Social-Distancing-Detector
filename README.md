# Social-Distancing-Detector
**Device that measures the distance, shows colors of safety and alerts, if distancing isnt maintained**


## Components Used

* Ultrasonic Sensor
* Arduino Uno
* NEO Pixel Ring
* Buzzer


## Description
As per the World Health Organization “WHO” the safe distance is at least maintain 1 meter or 3 feet, while some people suggests that this distance should be around 6 feet. When the distance is less than or equal to 3 feet the LED module is automatically turned ON, and when the distance is greater than 3 feet than the LED module is turned OFF. You can increase the distance as per your requirement by simply changing the preset value.
